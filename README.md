# Proof of Authority Blockchain
The following assignment is to show comprehension and learning of blockchain testnet methods taught by the Rice University FinTech Bootcamp and 2U.  This is a hypothetical scenario and tokens inherently have no value here.[1]

## General Information

The following repository can be used for our team of developers and I to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.  I have decided on setting up a testnet because:

- There is no real money involved, which will give our team of developers the freedom to experiment.

- Testnets allows for offline development.

In order to set up a testnet, the following skills/tools are needed:

- Puppeth, to generate the genesis block.

- Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes, and connect the nodes together.

- The Clique Proof of Authority algorithm.

Tokens inherently have no value here, so provided pre-configured accounts and nodes for easy setup are available.[1]
